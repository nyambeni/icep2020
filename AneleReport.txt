Today I finally managed to push my work. The database is finished, the connection to the database with the app.js is also done.
Now I need to move the code for registration to the register.js page as well as the code for medical record to the doctor.js page

I finished the login page and the HOD dashboard backend 
We just need to work together to ensure that the frontend can retrieve from the backend. So far everything is coming along fine
