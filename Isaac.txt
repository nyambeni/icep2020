Before: I was working on the front-end creating login and register pages.
I was trying to connect the front-end and back-end and I eventually
managed.

During holidays: I was working on the APIs testing them making sure, they work as intended.

Currently: I'm creating services for the REST API and trying to 
share data across components.

4 - 8 Jan
I went through the system with the team and reported changes to be made.
I had to modify API and test them again. As I was getting data from 
the API I realise had to create sessions on the front-end and token.

10 -15 Jan
I went on learning about sessions and token. They are still giving
me hard time but I think I will manage to finish them over the weekends.


18 - 22 Jan
I created validation for the login and register, I did routing authentications
which is basically giving access to pages when rendering and worked on http intercepters.
