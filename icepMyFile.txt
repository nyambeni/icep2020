THOLINHLANHLA HLOPHE 

Before we closed, me and my team proposed to develop an online shopping system with Node JS and Angular. 
Firstly, I started familiarizing myself with Angular and creating a profile, history, and checkout pages. 
I decided to learn Node JS as well so that I can code backed to that pages. During this period, 
I can say it was more learning for me because I also master the basics of git and GitHub.
 
After closing I continue learning Node JS and Angular using tutorials videos on YouTube and I found it more 
interesting (21 Dec â€“ 31 Dec). Currently I am improving the system by coding checkout functionality.
