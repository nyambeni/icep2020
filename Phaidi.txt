Phaidi Mathabatha

Before we closed I was working on Staff log in, Patient info and Medical info back-end pages for the 
Patient Record System.

During the holidays I worked on or rather practiced Node.js a little bit, there is too much to know 
with little time to go about it.

I am currently busy with Angular, apart from my part on the group, it is third on the top three, it is 
definitely on my need-to-know list.
