Before we closed I was working on Staff log in, Patient info and Medical info back-end pages for the 
Patient Record System.

During the holidays I worked on or rather practiced Node.js a little bit, there is too much to know 
with little time to go about it.

I am currently busy with Angular, apart from my part on the group, it is third on the top three, it is 
definitely on my need-to-know list.

I have managed to cover the basics of angular initializing, how to create components, services, how 
angular interacts.

First thing when we restarted working on the Patient Record system, i was tasked to create an API for 
medical record, but my progress was without luck.

I am currently busy learning the procedures of an API, basically how to create an API, so far, i managed
to get "cannot POST" error, work in progress.

Our supervisors suggested to micro manage our project due to lack of progress. They have created a Git 
repository, we had to create our branches from the main.

I am tasked with a front-end page "Patient Bookings" for Patien Record sytem. Since it is a basic Agular 
task, i dont imagine i will not be facing any challenges.

I completed all my page, so far the only challenge i had was with "bookings.component.ts" file's code but
with an assistance of research and my fellow developers, i managed to deliver in time.

It is our presentation week, last week Friday we failed to present due to the other developers pair on our 
group "patient registration" page (front and back-end), the back-end developer failed to push to Git.

Every developer had to focus on the main functions of the system,  which was to print a medical record and
manage bookings for patients.

On Friday "presentation day", due to social distancing, we presented online using Teams, we had technical errors
"Network problems". Before we could finish, they gave us onther project and at that moment they told us "Patient
Record System" is done, our project was a mobile app, using IONIC.
