Before we closed I was working on Staff log in, Patient info and Medical info back-end pages for the 
Patient Record System.

During the holidays I worked on or rather practiced Node.js a little bit, there is too much to know 
with little time to go about it.

I am currently busy with Angular, apart from my part on the group, it is third on the top three, it is 
definitely on my need-to-know list.

I have managed to cover the basics of angular initializing, how to create components, services, how 
angular interacts.

First thing when we restarted working on the Patient Record system, i was tasked to create an API for 
medical record, but my progress was without luck.

I am currently busy learning the procedures of an API, basically how to create an API, so far, i managed
to get "cannot POST" error, work in progress.
