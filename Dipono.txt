Thats my name


Before we go for recess I was starting, I decided to learn Angular, to desingning some client
pages, I created some few page on the 15th of December it was before I knew git, I came with
on my USB I presented them to my team, they were inpressed with what I did, but that time I was
struggling with navigation, that was my home work to figure it out, but I decided to jump into
back-end on the 16th I started to learn node js I was struggling to connect node js to database.

During my recess I was still leaning funally I was able to connect Node to Mysql, also knew hot
to insert, retrieve, update, and to delete data to or from database. to me a while to be able to
connect front-end to back-end.

I was writting agile42 assessment, I did not complete it due to network problem, probably I will
done with it tomorrow.

08/01/2021
I continued with the assessment and I am done with it, I got certificate of it.

13/01/2021
I am done with a login page, I am starting with navigation.

14/01/2021
Apparently I am not done yet with the login since I did not intergrate it with back-end, 
so I had to go back to intagrate them, and stop with navigation, so I decided to take one task
at a time.

15/01/2021
Could not complete the login page, we had a network issues, we could not colaborate on git,
since BA's provided us with ERD then I design the database from the ERD.

18/01/2021
Now I am done with Login only the validations left, now I am moving to Registration page

19/01/2021
Also I am done with Registration page from back-end to front-end but also no validations,
and they gave me another task to design another database.
 
20/01/2021
Done with database I shared it on Slack and I also managed to navigate through those pages

21/01/2021
I included the valiadtion on those pages I was working on both Login and Registration pages

22/01/2021
Today we presented our system unfortunatly they did not focus on the pages that I created, 
they focused on the function on the system.
