Jali Our first week at ICEP I and my team were developing a web application for Kota ordering, I was working on the back-end to create API's and the server. i managed to create API's but couldn't connect them to the front en, during the holidays i tried to research on how to do log in API's and how to connect to front end, and i m currently learning about tokens and how to connect the front end and back-end.
11/01/2020 -- 15/01/2021, Managed to do an API for Ordering in our system and it was working perfect, then by friday i started an API for Menu and i had an issie with the image uploading section, i did not understand hotw it works and wat is reallly needed so i finished the week stuck on the uploading part.
