Before we closed, i created a new page that worked with the backend
to display the data from the database, where the admin can see the 
registered students.

During the holidays i did not do anything since i knew that i had 
failed one module which meant i was no longer part of ICEP.

Since the above mentioned matter has been cleared for me yesterday,
today i have been working on finding a way to collect data from the form
and store it in the database because the only data we can read now ,is 
the one we manually entered in the database myphp.
